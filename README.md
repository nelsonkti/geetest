To get the latest version of Laravel Geetest, simply require the project using Composer:

```
$ composer require nelsons/geetest
```

```
$ composer update
```

Next, You should need to register the service provider. Open up `config/app.php` and add following into the `providers` key:

```php
Nelsons\Geetest\GeetestServiceProvider::class
```

And you can register the Geetest Facade in the `aliases` of `config/app.php` :

```php
'Geetest' => Nelsons\Geetest\Geetest::class
```

## Configuration

To get started, you need to publish vendor assets using the following command:

```
$ php artisan vendor:publish --tag=geetest
```

This will create a config file named `config/geetest.php` which you can configure geetest as you like.

It will also generate a views folder named `resources/views/vendor/geetest`, there will be a view file named `geetest.blade.php`. Here you can configure styles of geetest. For example, you can change the script `alert()` as you like.
